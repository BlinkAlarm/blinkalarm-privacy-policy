### Friend Bells Feature - Call and SMS Data

The Friend Bells feature helps you maintain relationships by tracking when you last contacted people in your groups. To provide timely reminders, the Application may access:

- Call log timestamps and phone numbers
- SMS message timestamps and phone numbers

The Application does **not** read message content, call recordings, or any other personal communication data.
